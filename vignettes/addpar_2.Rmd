## Parameters of nnet

The basic usage of our algorithm is based on logistic regression implementation of `nnet` package. We allow to pass to our main wrapper function `capacity_logreg_main` some parameters of original `nnet::nnet` and `nnet::multinom` functions. These are:

* `lr_maxit` (default = 1000) - sets the maximum number of iterations of optimisation step in logistic regression algorithm. Set to higher value if your data is more complex or of high dimension
* `MaxNWts` (default = 5000) - sets the maximum number of weights defined in logistic regression model. Set to higher value if you data has many dimensions or signal has many states.

Here would be examples showing the importance of these paramteres
