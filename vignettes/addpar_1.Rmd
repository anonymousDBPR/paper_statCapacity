## Additional parameters of capacity_logreg_main

Apart from crucial parameters for the algorithm estimation, the main wrapper function `capacity_logreg_main` has also other parameters than can be used to tune the functioning of the package. These are

* `model_out` (default=TRUE) - specify if nnet model object should saved into output file
* `graphs` (default=TRUE) - controls creating diagnostic plots in the output directory.
* `plot_width` (default = 6) - the width of the created plots 
* `plot_height` (default = 4) - the height of the created plots
* `scale` (default = TRUE) - logical value indicating if the response columns of `dataRaw` are to be scaled, what is recommended. This choice should be approached similarly as in PCA decomposition for instance.


In the future, here will be an example how the scaling could change the result.
